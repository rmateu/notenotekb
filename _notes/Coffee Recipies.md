**[AeroPourOver][apo]**

- 15 gr (medium course)
- 240ml water
- Stir 
- Let it flow
- Around 1 level, give it a stir. 

It should take 4 to 6 minutes 

Using the aeropress filter the drip takes too long. Going to test with a regular filter.

This recipe is not working for me. Latest test with regular filter didn't work too great.
